df['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

# Plot clusters
plt.scatter(df['AnnualIncome'], df['SpendingScore'], c=df['Cluster'], cmap='viridis')
plt.xlabel('Annual Income')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score')
plt.title('Customer Segmentation')
plt.show()
Data Visualization:

Using Matplotlib (Python):
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Scatter plot of customer segments
plt.scatter(df['Age'], df['AnnualIncome'], c=df['Cluster'], cmap='viridis')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Annual Income')
plt.title('Customer Segmentation')
plt.show()
Reporting:

Write a Summary Report:
markdown
Copy code
**Customer Segmentation Analysis Report**

- **Segments Identified:** 3 distinct customer segments based on age, income, and spending score.
- **Segment Profiles:** 
  - Segment 1: Young, high-income, high-spending.
  - Segment 2: Middle-aged, moderate-income, moderate-spending.
  - Segment 3: Older, lower-income, low-spending.
- **Recommendations:** Tailor marketing strategies for each segment based on their profiles.
Project 3: Financial Data Analysis and Forecasting
Objective: Analyze financial data to forecast revenue and identify cost-saving opportunities.

Steps and Instructions:
Data Collection:

Sample Data (CSV):
plaintext
Copy code
Date,Revenue,Expenses
2024-01,10000,7000
2024-02,11000,7500
2024-03,12000,8000
Data Cleaning:

Using Python (Pandas):
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('financial_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Fill or drop missing values if any
df = df.dropna()
Data Analysis:

Using Python (Linear Regression for Forecasting):
python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Prepare data
df['Month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date']).dt.month
X = df[['Month']].values
y = df['Revenue'].values

# Apply linear regression
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
df['Forecast'] = model.predict(X)

# Plot actual vs forecasted revenue
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Revenue'], label='Actual Revenue')
plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Forecast'], label='Forecasted Revenue', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel('Date')

Work on large dataset 
ChatGPT
Working with large datasets often involves additional considerations, such as optimizing performance and managing memory usage. Here’s a detailed approach for each project using large datasets, including techniques for handling large volumes of data efficiently.

Project 1: Sales Analysis and Reporting
Objective: Analyze large sales data to identify trends and patterns to support strategic decision-making.

Steps and Instructions:
Data Collection:

Data Source: Use a large sales dataset (e.g., data from an e-commerce platform).
Sample Data (CSV): For a large dataset, assume you have a file like large_sales_data.csv.

Data Cleaning:

Using Python (Pandas):
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load data in chunks to handle large files
chunk_size = 10**6  # Adjust chunk size based on your system's memory
chunks = pd.read_csv('large_sales_data.csv', chunksize=chunk_size)

# Combine chunks into a single DataFrame
df = pd.concat(chunks)

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Fill or drop missing values if any
df = df.dropna()
Data Analysis:

Using SQL (SQLite Example):
sql
Copy code
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE sales (
    Date DATE,
    Product TEXT,
    Region TEXT,
    Sales INTEGER
);

-- Import data from CSV
.import large_sales_data.csv sales

-- Query total sales by product
SELECT Product, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM sales
GROUP BY Product;
Data Visualization:

Using Power BI:
Load the large CSV file into Power BI.
Create visuals such as bar charts and line charts.
Use Power BI’s built-in features to handle large datasets efficiently (e.g., aggregations, data reduction techniques).
Reporting:

Write a Summary Report:
markdown
Copy code
**Sales Analysis Report**

- **Total Sales by Product:** Widget A: $X, Widget B: $Y
- **Sales Trends:** Insights from the large dataset reveal key trends.
- **Recommendations:** Focus on high-performing products and regions.
